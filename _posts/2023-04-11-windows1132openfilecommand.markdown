<p>进入command，直接输入需要打开的文件的名称， 然后按enter键即可</p>

<p>On &nbsp;a Windows machine, we can open a text file from command prompt by just giving the file name.<br />
For example to open a text file named file1.txt, we just need to type file1.txt in the command prompt and press <em>&lsquo;Enter&rsquo;.&nbsp;</em></p>

{% highlight %}
{% highlight %}c:&gt; file1.txt{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note that file name should have the extension as .txt otherwise command prompt would not be able to identify which application need to be used to open the file.</p>
